						<div class="text-center">
							<hr class="orange-divider" style="width: 15%;">
						</div>
						<p class="lead fw-bold">GOD the FATHER
						<p>
							We believe that there is one God who exists in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the
							Holy Spirit.
						</p>
						<p class="lead fw-bold">GOD the SON (Jesus)
						<p>
							We believe that Jesus is the Son of God, was born of a virgin, was fully God and fully
							human. He lived a sinless life, died in our place as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity,
							was buried, arose bodily from the grave, and ascended into Heaven.
						</p>
						<p class="lead fw-bold">GOD the HOLY SPIRIT
						<p>
							We believe that God the Holy Spirit is active in convincing unbelievers of their need for
							salvation. He is the Comforter and Guide Who lives in every believer.
						</p>
						<p class="lead fw-bold">THE BIBLE
						<p>
							We believe that the Bible is the Word of God without any error, the sole authority for life
							and faith.
						</p>
						<p class="lead fw-bold">HUMANITY
						<p>
							We believe that humanity is a special creation of God, made in His image. Through the sin of
							the first man, Adam, humanity fell so that all people are sinners and need salvation.
						</p>
						<p class="lead fw-bold">SALVATION
						<p>
							We believe that salvation is a gift received through repentance toward God and faith in the
							Lord Jesus Christ.
						</p>
						<p class="lead fw-bold">THE CHURCH
						<p>
							We believe that the church is a local body of baptized believers with the Lord Jesus Christ
							as the Head.
						</p>
						<p class="lead fw-bold">PRAYER
						<p>
							We believe that each believer has direct access to God through the Lord Jesus Christ.
						</p>
						<p>
							New Day Church is a cooperating Southern Baptist Church that affirms the <a
								href="https://bfm.sbc.net/bfm2000/">Baptist Faith and Message 2000.</a></p>
