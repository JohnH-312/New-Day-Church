                <p>Growing up in the West Nashville area, James spent his formative years at Park Avenue Baptist Church where he became a Christian at the age of 12. Several years later, while serving in the youth ministry area, James felt God leading him to become a full-time minister. He started out in youth work before transitioning to a pastoral role, and he is still serving as passionately almost 30 years later. He has also added education to his toolbox, with a Master’s degree in Christian Education, a Masters of Divinity degree, and a Doctorate of Ministry degree.</p>
